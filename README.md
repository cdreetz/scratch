# scratch

In today's day in age, where the majority of code being written is with the help of intellisense, Copilot, or ChatGPT, I felt the 
need to spend some time writing neural networks from scratch and off the top of my head as much as possible.  Originally was just going to be pure numpy nn modules 
but ended up going back and swapping out np for tensors so I could try out PyTorch's Apple Metal "mps" since I basically only had ever used CUDA on my PC.
